    "This piece of coursework will test you on what you have learnt in the first half of the course. It is due in by 1.00 pm on Friday 1st November 2019 and you wil receive your marks and feedback by Friday 22nd November. As with the formative coursework, the marks available are indicated for each question. Input your answers into the code and markdown cells provided.\n",

    "Your coursework will be marked using the same version of Python as is available in the Simon building computer cluster. It is your responsibility to ensure that your code works in this version of Python. If your code does not run correctly due to incompatibility issues between the version of Python you used and the version that is used to mark your coursework, you will not get the marks! Therefore, it is recommended that you test your code in the Simon building cluster before you submit.\n",

    "In this piece of coursework, we are going to model the oscillations of a damped spring (which might be used in a car's suspension, for example) which is subjected to a time-varying forcing (which could be caused by the driver's pattern of acceleration and braking and the associated interacation of the car with the road's surface). This problem can be modelled by the following differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2u(t)}{dt^2}+D\\frac{du(t)}{dt}+Su(t)=f(t),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u(t)$ is the displacement of the spring in mm at time $t$ seconds, $D$ is a constant associated with the spring's damping, $S$ is a constant associated with its stiffness and $f(t)$ is a function that represents the time-varying forcing. The specific form of $f(t)$ you will be asked to use will be generated based on your student ID number (this should be something like 9023839). Please enter it into the code below after the equals sign on the first row, then run the code. You will then see a printed message telling you what form of $f(t)$ to use for the rest of the coursework. It is essential that you enter the correct student ID number, otherwise you may be accused of plagiarism."
